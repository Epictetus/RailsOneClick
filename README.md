# Rails One Click Install for Mac Os X (10.6 or higher)

This software allows one click install of Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails (the most
recent version).

### Ruby sandbox

Ruby will not be installed globally, instead you'll be able to open and
create rails apps directly from the RailsOneClick app.


### Project status

This project is alpha. I'm looking for contributors and especially
testers. Your help is much apreciated.
