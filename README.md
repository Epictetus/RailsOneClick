# Rails One Click Install for Mac Os X (10.6 or higher)

This software allows one click install of Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails (the most
recent version).

This software is not ready! I'm still working out some major problems.

Current problems/features to add:

* Doesn't tell if the installation fails. I'm working on this!
* Add a log interface for the installation.
* Add a better interface for managing rails apps
* The UI sucks!

### Ruby sandbox

Ruby will not be installed globally, instead you'll be able to open and
create rails apps directly from the RailsOneClick app.

### Project status

This project is alpha. I'm looking for contributors and especially
testers. Your help is much apreciated.

Developers note: rvm will conflict with Rails one click. It is
recommended that you temporarily comment it out in your profile file
while you test this project.

### How to run it

Right now, download the xcode project, build and run and follow
instructions!

### History

Yehuda Katz has recently announced the need for a Rails one click installer
for Mac Os X. He even got some founding for his project, which means the
community really needs it. With Rails one
click I want to create a first step toward that vision that Yehuda had.
I really hope this project will be useful to Yehuda and eventually for
the Ruby community itself.
