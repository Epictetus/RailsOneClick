# Rails One Click Install for Mac Os X (10.6 or higher)

This software allows one click install of Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails (the most
recent version).

This software is not ready! I'm still working out the interface for the
first alpha release.

Current problems:

* Doesn't tell if the installation fails.
* Once Ruby is installed, you're stuck!

### Ruby sandbox

Ruby will not be installed globally, instead you'll be able to open and
create rails apps directly from the RailsOneClick app.

### Project status

This project is alpha. I'm looking for contributors and especially
testers. Your help is much apreciated.

Developers note: rvm will conflict with Rails one click. It is
recommended that you temporarily comment it out.in your profile file
